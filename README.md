I am currently actively seeking a new role as a Frontend Developer.

As an experienced Frontend Developer, I bring years of expertise in crafting innovative and user-friendly web applications. I am proficient in React, Typescript, and related front-end technologies.

During my free time, I dedicate myself to studying open-sourced technologies, practicing Leetcode, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, reading books, brewing pour-over coffee, exploring nature, and cherishing valuable moments with friends and family.

On the side, I am committed to providing free and accessible mentorship. If you're interested, feel free to schedule a chat with me on [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/brian-lau) :-)
